Additionally, it the repo can be cloned and modified to unit test custom scripts using NiFi's mock framework.

## Sample Scripts
Scripts are designed to demonstrate basic techniques in various languages:

| Topic | Javascript | Python |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Reading and writing flowfile attributes | attributes.js | attributes.py |
| Logging | log.js | log.py |
| Transforming an input flowfile to a single output | transform.js | transform.py |
| Splitting an input flowfile to multiple outputs | split.js | split.py |

## Contributing
Please help.  These sample scripts are very likely to be buggy, unnecessarily complicated, misguided, downright stupid, or all of the above.
